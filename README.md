# Ecommerce- Backend training 

In this demo, I test out the GET, PUT, and POST routes for the back end of an ecommerce website.

# Closing statements

I wasn't able to do this assignment earlier in the course because i still didnt understand very well how routes work, but doing it now after going through many other difficult things was a breeze, and im happy that i got back to it.
